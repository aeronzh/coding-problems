    "### Solution Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of cells where the mayor can place lampposts is $total = nm$. Next we group each input $(row, c_1, c_2)$ by $row$. For that we use a dictionary `map` with `map[row]` holding a list of intervals $(c_1, c_2)$ for $row$. For instance, if our input looks as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "4 4 4\n",
    "2 2 3\n",
    "3 1 4\n",
    "4 4 4\n",
    "3 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "our `map` will look as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "map[1] -> []\n",
    "map[2] -> [[2,3]]\n",
    "map[3] -> [[1,4],[2,3]]\n",
    "map[4] -> [[4,4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the first row is our problem configuration ($n,m$ and $k$).\n",
    "This map can be constructed in $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we iterate over our `map` and _merge_ the interval list in case of any overlapping intervals. For instance, if we have the folloing interval list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]\n",
    "```\n",
    "the merged list will looks as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, once we have a _merged_ the interval list for each $row$ in `map`, all that is left to do ist sum the number of columns each interval list occupies for each $row$ in `map` and subtract it from $total$. For example, the following interval list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]\n",
    "```\n",
    "occupies $13$ columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finaly, return $total$.\n"
