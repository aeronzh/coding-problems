    "Given an array of integers $Y = [y_1, y_2, ... y_n]$ , we have $n$ line segments, such that, the endpoints of $i^{\\text{th}}$ segment are $(i,0)$ and $(i,y_i)$. Imagine that from the top of each segment a horizontal ray is shot to the left, and this ray stops when it touches another segment or it hits the y-axis. We construct an array of $n$ integers, $[v_1,v_2,...,v_n]$ , where $v_i$ is equal to length of ray shot from the top of segment $i$. We define $V(y_1,y_2,...,y_n) = v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_n$. \n",

Then at any of the preceding segments there may be some $y_{@j}$ with $j < i$, which is taller than or equal to $y_{@i}$. Let $P[y_{@i-1} \\ge y_{@i}]$ be the probability that the preceding $y_{@i-1}$ is taller than or equal to $y_{@i}$. Let $P[y_{@i-2} \\ge y_{@i}]$ be the probability that the preceding $y_{@i-2}$ is taller than or equal to $y_{@i}$ and $y_{@i-1}$ is smaller than $y_{@i}$. Let $P[y_{@i-3} \\ge y_{@i}]$ be the probability that the preceding $y_{@i-3}$ is taller than or equal to $y_{@i}$ and $y_{@i-1}$ as well as $y_{@i-2}$ is smaller than $y_{@i}$. Similar for the remaining preceding segments up until $P[y_{@1} \\ge y_{@i}]$. The $E[v_i]$ is then equal to:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of it is to illustrate the above thought as follows. We will illustrate the $y's$ as circles. The $y$ at segment $i$ is denoted with a $\\bigstar$. Preceding $y_{@j}$ with $j < i$, which are smaller than $y_{@i}$ are denoted with $\\square$. The first (from right to left) preceding $y$ that is equal to or taller than \n",
