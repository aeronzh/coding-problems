    "### Similar Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimmy loves playing with strings. He thinks string $A$ is similar to string $B$ if the following conditions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both strings have the same length (i.e., $A = a_0 a_1 ... a_{n-1}$  and $B = b_0 b_1 ... b_{n-1}$).\n",
    "- For each valid pair of indices,$(i,j)$, in the strings, $[a_i = a_j$ and $b_i = b_j]$ or $[a_i \\ne a_j$ and $b_i \\ne b_j]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has string, $S$, size of $n$ and gives you $q$ queries to answer where each query is in the form of a pair of integers $(i_i, r_i)$. For each substring $S[l_i, r_i]$, find the number of substrings $S[x,y]$ where substring $S[l_i, r_i]$ is similar to substring $S[x,y]$ and print this number on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Substring $S[x,y]$ is the contiguous sequence of characters from index $x$ to index $y$. For example, if $S=$ `abcdefgh`, then $S[3,6]=$ `cdef`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of $n$ and $q$. \n",
    "The second line contains string $S$. \n",
    "Each line $i$ of the $q$ subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of $l_i$ and $r_i$ for query i.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**\n",
    "- $1\\le n,q\\le 5 \\times 10^4$\n",
    "- $1\\le L_i\\le R_i \\le n$\n",

    "1. Strings with length $1$ are all similar, so our answer is $8$.\n",
    "2. `gi`, `ig`, `ga`, `ab`, `ba`, and `aj` are similar, so our answer is $6$.\n",
    "3. `gig` and `aba` are similar, so our answer is $2$.\n",
    "4. `igg` has no similar string, so our answer is $1$.\n"

    "### Naive Implementation\n",
    "1. Init $counter=0$.\n",
    "2. Generate all substrings of $S$ and store them in a dictionary $dict$, with $dict[l]$ holding the list of substrings with length $l$.\n",
    "3. Compute the length of the query $q$.\n",
    "4. Iterate over all substrings that have the length of the query.\n",
    "5. For $q$ and for each substring generate a $signature$, based on the above conditions as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example \"ggi\":\n",
    "        1st 2nd 3rd\n",

    "3rd\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Notice the symmetry of the table.\n",
    "6. Compare the $signatures$ and increment the $counter$ on equality."
