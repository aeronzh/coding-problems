    "### Two Characters\n",
    "String $t$ always consists of two distinct alternating characters. For example, if string $t$'s two distinct characters are `x` and `y`, \n",
    "then $t$ could be `xyxyx` or `yxyxy` but not `xxyy` or `xyyx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert some string $s$ to string $t$ by deleting characters from $s$. When you delete a character from $s$, you must delete _all_\n",
    "occurrences of it in $s$. For example, if $s=$ `abaacdabd` and you delete the character `a`, then the string becomes `bcdbd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $s$, convert it to the longest possible string $t$. Then print the length of string $t$ on a new line; if no string $t$ can be formed from $s$, print $0$ instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains a single integer denoting the length of $s$. \n",
    "The second line contains string $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**\n",
    "- $1 \\le |s| \\le 1000$\n",
    "- $s$ only contains lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., `a` to `z`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "Print a single integer denoting the maximum length of $t$ for the given $s$; if it is not possible to form string $t$, print $0$ instead.\n",

    "**Sample Output**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The characters present in $s$ are `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f`. This means that $t$ must consist of _two_ of those characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we delete `e` and `f`, the resulting string is `babab`. This is a valid $t$ as there are only two distinct characters (`a` and `b`), \n",
    "and they are alternating within the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we delete `a` and `f`, the resulting string is `bebeeeb`. This is not a valid string $t$ because there are _three_ consecutive `e`'s present.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we delete only `e`, the resulting string is `babfab`. This is not a valid string $t$ because it contains _three_ distinct characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we print the length of `babab`, which is $5$, as our answer."
