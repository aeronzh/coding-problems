/**
 * Bomberman lives in a rectangular grid with R rows and C columns. Each cell in
 * the grid either contains a bomb or nothing at all.
 * 
 * Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but, once planted, it will
 * detonate after exactly 3 seconds. Once a bomb detonates, it's destroyed â€”
 * along with anything in its four neighboring cells. This means that if a bomb
 * detonates in cell i,j, cells (i +- 1, j) and (i, i +- 1) are cleared (note
 * that cells at the edge of the grid have less than four neighboring cells). If
 * there is a bomb in a neighboring cell, the neighboring bomb is destroyed
 * without detonating (i.e., no chain reaction occurs).
 * 
 * Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid.
 * Here's what he does:
 * 
 * 1. Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells.
 * 
 * 2. After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
 * 
 * 3. After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without bombs,
 * thus filling the whole grid with bombs. It is guaranteed that no bombs will
 * detonate at this second.
 * 
 * 4. After one more second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago will
 * detonate. Here, Bomberman stands back and observes.
 * 
 * 5. Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.
 * 
 * 
 * Note that during every second Bomberman plants bombs, the bombs are planted
 * simultaneously (i.e., at the exact same moment), and any bombs planted at the
 * same time will detonate at the same time.
 * 
 * Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Bomberman's
 * first batch of planted bombs, determine the state of the grid after N
 * seconds.

	/**
	 * Thanks to baranoob from the forums:
	 * 
	 * I solved the problem using the following tricks. I guess my solution is
	 * not perfect but I hope it can help who struggled. Assume using the
	 * following time:
	 * 
	 * N = 0 (initial board - time of bomb is 3)
	 * 
	 * N = 1 (do nothing - time of bomb is reduced to 2)
	 * 
	 * N = 2 (time of existing bombs is reduced to 1, add new bombs to empty
	 * cells with time 3)
	 * 
	 * N = 3 (boms with time 1 will exploded, new boms added in previous steps
	 * have time reduced to 2).
	 * 
	 * I use the following test to illustrate my algorithm.
	 * 
	 * 4 3
	 * 
	 * O..O
	 * 
	 * .O..
	 * 
	 * ....
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * I convert it to the following arrays in my solution:
	 * 
	 * 3 0 0 3
	 * 
	 * 0 3 0 0
	 * 
	 * 0 0 0 0
	 * 
	 * 
	 * (3 is bomb with time 3. 0 is empty cells i.e has no bombs).
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Below are some observation:
	 * 
	 * 1/ When N = 4, N = 6, ..., board is full of bombs.
	 * 
	 * 2/ Board at N = 3 is the same with board at N = 7, N = 11
	 * 
	 * 3/ Board at N = 5 is the same with board at N = 9, N = 13
	 * 
	 * 4/ To solve board at N = 3. Calculate board at N = 2
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Given example a board with N = 0 N = 2
	 * 
	 * 3 0 0 3 1 3 3 1
	 * 
	 * 0 3 0 0 -> 3 1 3 3
	 * 
	 * 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
	 * 
	 * 
	 * After 1 second (N = 3), cell with 1 will explode to 0 and make neighbour
	 * cells become 0. Cells with 3 become 2.
	 * 
	 * N = 3
	 * 
	 * 0 0 0 0
	 * 
	 * 0 0 0 0
	 * 
	 * 2 0 2 2
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 5/ To solve board at N = 5. Use board at N = 3. N = 3 N = 5
	 * 
	 * 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2
	 * 
	 * 0 0 0 0 -> 0 2 0 0
	 * 
	 * 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0
	 * 
	 * Note that cells with 0 become 2 and cells with 2 become 0. This is
	 * because
	 * 
	 * - cells with 0 is empty cells and it will be populated with bombs at
	 * previous step (N = 4).
	 * 
	 * - cells with 2 is bomb cells and it will explode to 0 and make neighbour
	 * cells become 0.
